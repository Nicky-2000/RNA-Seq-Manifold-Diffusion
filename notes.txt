General Apis For the project. 


Data Loaders: 
- Need something to load in some RNA data. 
- Need something to make a swiss roll data set. 


Manifold learning thing
- We need to take in a data set. And then we need to output some representation of a manifold. Maybe we just output a "noising function" or something here that can be passed into our diffusion model? 
- What else could this step be? 

Diffusion model. 
- I guess we would like one diffusion model that we can just initialize with a different "noise function" 
- Everything else should be the same except they have different noising functions


Metrics: 
- We need to take in two diffusion models and a set of points taht will be our samples (maybe 10 points). 
- Therefore we will get 2 outputs (one per model) per data point in the set of points
- Then we need to compare the 2 sets of output points (maybe against our learned manifold?)
- Maybe in terms of something else? Quality? 
- then if we want to test sample efficiency of the mainfold learned diffusion. Maybe we only train the mainifold diffusion model with 50% of the data as the other one. 
- What else could we do here?
